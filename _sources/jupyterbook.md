<!-- - Much LaTeX functionality and 
- Cross references over multiple files
- Figures with captions
- Proofs, Theorems, etc
    - `pip install sphinx-proof`
- Results, `glue`
- The result looks like a script
- Markdown files can also be executed with `jupytext` -->

## NGSolve in Jupyter-Book

Provided that NGSolve is installed in the python environment, NGSolve can also be integrated in a Juptyter book.

In order to be able to use the **webgui** in a book, the `webgui.js` must be saved in the `./_static` directory. This can be done with the following script:

```{code-cell} ipython3
from webgui_jupyter_widgets.js import widget_code 

fp = open("_static/webgui.js", "w")
fp.write(widget_code)
fp.close()
```
